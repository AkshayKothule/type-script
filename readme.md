TypeScript being a "Syntactic Superset" means that it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it.

# TS
1)string represents string values like "Hello, world"
2)number is for numbers like 42. JavaScript does not have a special runtime value for integers, so there’s no equivalent to int or float - everything is simply number
3)boolean is for the two values true and false

any 

TypeScript also has a special type, any, that you can use whenever you don’t want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.
